## Description
Health Quest is a RESTful API-based web app that aims to provide users with a place to learn and implement good health practices into their routines.

Health Quest uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, Handlebars.js as the template engine, and MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
User authentication via express-session and cookies protects sensitive user information within a user account.

Future development of this app would include expansion of the personal account, allowing a user to store information on their daily habits, progress, and goals for personal growth.
